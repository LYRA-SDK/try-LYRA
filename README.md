# LYRA: Privacy-First AI SDK for Fitness Developers

## Why LYRA?  
Fitness studios collect tons of health data but struggle to keep it safe. **A 2024 analysis by Surfshark found that 80% of top fitness apps share user data with third parties**, risking massive GDPR fines and destroying member trust. LYRA SDK fixes this problem with:  
- **Differential Privacy** – We add just enough noise to protect individual identities while keeping insights valuable.  
- **Federated Learning** – Train AI models across multiple studios without raw data ever leaving their walls.  
- **Actionable Fitness Insights** – Spot injury risks before they happen while keeping member data private.

## Try LYRA SDK
See our developer-friendly approach in action:  
1. **Run the SDK Demo Container**  
   - Build with `docker build -t lyra-sdk-demo .`
   - Launch with `docker run -p 5001:5000 -p 8502:8501 lyra-sdk-demo`
   - Access the demonstration dashboard at http://localhost:8502
   
2. **Explore the Integration Demo**
   - Upload our sample_data.csv (or generate your own with sample.py)
   - Watch how member IDs get anonymized automatically
   - See the privacy budget metrics in real-time
   - Understand how your applications can deliver actionable injury risk predictions without compromising privacy

Developers no longer need to choose between AI insights and privacy - LYRA SDK delivers both.

## Technical Details

LYRA SDK uses a combination of technologies to ensure privacy while providing valuable insights:

- **API-based Architecture**: Separate frontend and backend services for scalability
- **Docker Containerization**: Easy integration across development environments
- **Streamlit Dashboard**: Example interface showing how fitness professionals can use your application
- **Mathematical Privacy Guarantees**: Epsilon values track privacy budget usage
