## 🛡️ Why LYRA?  
Fitness studios collect sensitive health data but lack tools to protect it. **60% of fitness apps leak data** (FTC 2024), risking $10M GDPR fines and member trust. LYRA solves this with:  
- **Differential Privacy** – Add mathematical noise to protect identities.  
- **Federated Learning** – Train AI across devices without centralizing data.  
- **Fitness-Specific Insights** – Injury risk prediction, workout personalization.
